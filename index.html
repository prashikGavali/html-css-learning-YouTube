            <p>Social responsibility is the idea that an individual (or organization) has an obligation to act for the benefit of society at large. Today, social responsibility has become an important part of culture at businesses of all sizes. TOMS Shoes
                is an excellent example of a business that prioritizes social responsibility. TOMS was founded with the commitment to provide a new pair of shoes for a child in need for every pair of shoes purchased. The company has now expanded to support
                other causes such as safe water, mental health, and equality. TOMS Shoes’ inspirational tagline “Stand for Tomorrow” communicates its dedication to social responsibility in just three words. Social responsibility can be practiced in big
                or small ways every day. Businesses can volunteer with local organizations, donate funds to a chosen cause, sponsor a neighborhood group or sports team, and much more. Even planting flowers, applying a fresh coat of paint, or picking up
                trash in front of your store has a positive impact on the community surrounding your business. When businesses give back, they not only contribute to the common good, they engage with their communities in meaningful ways, build morale
                among employees, and create positive regard for the business.</p>

            <p>CSS is important because it allows web designers, developer, bloggers, and so forth to make our websites unique and attractive. CSS gives us the opportunity to play with a page layout, adjust colors and fonts, add effects to images, etc. While
                in the past it was possible to add style via HTML or more simpler CSS, CSS3 has really expanded and allows for more creativity. Ultimately, it makes our lives easier. CSS allows us to separate the presentation from the structure (HTML)
                into different files.</p>
